Random Side Project - Wordle Clone

Backstory - Grandma was using a wordle clone instead of the actual wordle service and didn't realize it.  Made me curious how simple it would be to set up a basic working version.

Backstony Technical Detail - Decided to try making this wordle clone using IntelliJ since I am unfamiliar with it.  I normally use Eclipse or Visual Studio Code.  Took a moment to figure out how to use IntelliJ with Git and relearning logic for more visual artifacts like JFrames - Grids - Warning Messages

Also decided to add in maven so I could set up CI through git.  Just got it all set up and had to work through some file structure issues with intelliJ.  IntelliJ seems to do package/file structures in an unfamiliar way to me.  Now I could add in JUnit tests and make sure my CI will check with them before merging.
