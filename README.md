Wordle Copycat - was curious how it was set up and wanted an excuse to try using IntelliJ since I normally use eclipse.
    Went pretty well, it took longer figuring out how to use IntelliJ with Git and relearning JFrame stuff than the actual implementation took.

Backstory - Grandma was using a wordle clone instead of the actual wordle service and didn't realize it.  Made me curious how simple it would be to set up a basic working version.
